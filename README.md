# EscapeRoom
 
This project is a web-based interactive escape room game designed to demonstrate NP-completeness and NP-hardness through Hamiltonian path puzzles

The goal is to provide a non-technical audience with an intuitive, hands-on experience of complex computational theories.

# Getting Started 
Run node server.js in the root directory to run on local machine
